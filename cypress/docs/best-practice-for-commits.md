## Best practices for commits

## Commits:

### To keep a project tidy when incorporating branches with new features into master/main when writing a standardized commit message, the commit message should be structured as follows:

#### fix: a commit of type fix corrects a bug in the code.

#### feat: a commit of type feat introduces a new feature in the code

#### setup: a commit of type setup is used for environment, plugins, libraries and other configurations.

#### refact: a commit of type refact is used to improve the code, both in terms of readability and maintainability.

#### docs: a commit of type docs is used to add documentation and/or comments to the project.
